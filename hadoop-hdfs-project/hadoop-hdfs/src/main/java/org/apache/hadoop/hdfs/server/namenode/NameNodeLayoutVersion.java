   * <li>Define a new enum constant with a short enum name, the new layout version 
   * and description of the added feature.</li>
   * <li>When adding a layout version with an ancestor that is not same as
   * its immediate predecessor, use the constructor where a specific ancestor
   * can be passed.
   * </li>
   * <li>Specify a minimum compatible layout version.  The minimum compatible
   * layout version is the earliest prior version to which a downgrade is
   * possible after initiating rolling upgrade.  If the feature cannot satisfy
   * compatibility with any prior version, then set its minimum compatible
   * lqyout version to itself to indicate that downgrade is impossible.
   * Satisfying compatibility might require adding logic to the new feature to
   * reject operations or handle them differently while rolling upgrade is in
   * progress.  In general, it's possible to satisfy compatiblity for downgrade
   * if the new feature just involves adding new edit log ops.  Deeper
   * structural changes, such as changing the way we place files in the metadata
   * directories, might be incompatible.  Feature implementations should strive
   * for compatibility, because it's in the best interest of our users to
   * support downgrade.
