/**
 * Mount table resolver that supports multiple locations for each mount entry.
 * The returned location contains prioritized remote paths from highest priority
 * to the lowest priority. Multiple locations for a mount point are optional.
 * When multiple locations are specified, both will be checked for the presence
 * of a file and the nameservice for a new file/dir is chosen based on the
 * results of a consistent hashing algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Does the Mount table entry for this path have multiple destinations?
 * <ul>
 * <li>No: Return the location
 * <li>Yes: Return all locations, prioritizing the best guess from the
 * consistent hashing algorithm.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It has multiple options to order the locations: HASH (default), LOCAL,
 * RANDOM, and HASH_ALL.
 * <p>
 * The consistent hashing result is dependent on the number and combination of
 * nameservices that are registered for particular mount point. The order of
 * nameservices/locations in the mount table is not prioritized. Each consistent
 * hash calculation considers only the set of unique nameservices present for
 * the mount table location.
