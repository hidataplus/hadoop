/**
 * {@code LogAggregationContext} represents all of the
 * information needed by the {@code NodeManager} to handle
 * the logs for an application.
 * <p>
 * It includes details such as:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     includePattern. It uses Java Regex to filter the log files
 *     which match the defined include pattern and those log files
 *     will be uploaded when the application finishes.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     excludePattern. It uses Java Regex to filter the log files
 *     which match the defined exclude pattern and those log files
 *     will not be uploaded when application finishes. If the log file
 *     name matches both the include and the exclude pattern, this file
 *     will be excluded eventually.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     rolledLogsIncludePattern. It uses Java Regex to filter the log files
 *     which match the defined include pattern and those log files
 *     will be aggregated in a rolling fashion.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     rolledLogsExcludePattern. It uses Java Regex to filter the log files
 *     which match the defined exclude pattern and those log files
 *     will not be aggregated in a rolling fashion. If the log file
 *     name matches both the include and the exclude pattern, this file
 *     will be excluded eventually.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     policyClassName. The policy class name that implements
 *     ContainerLogAggregationPolicy. At runtime, nodemanager will the policy
 *     if a given container's log should be aggregated based on the
 *     ContainerType and other runtime state such as exit code by calling
 *     ContainerLogAggregationPolicy#shouldDoLogAggregation.
 *     This is useful when the app only wants to aggregate logs of a subset of
 *     containers. Here are the available policies. Please make sure to specify
 *     the canonical name by prefixing org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.
 *     nodemanager.containermanager.logaggregation.
 *     to the class simple name below.
 *     NoneContainerLogAggregationPolicy: skip aggregation for all containers.
 *     AllContainerLogAggregationPolicy: aggregate all containers.
 *     AMOrFailedContainerLogAggregationPolicy: aggregate application master
 *         or failed containers.
 *     FailedOrKilledContainerLogAggregationPolicy: aggregate failed or killed
 *         containers
 *     FailedContainerLogAggregationPolicy: aggregate failed containers
 *     AMOnlyLogAggregationPolicy: aggregate application master containers
 *     SampleContainerLogAggregationPolicy: sample logs of successful worker
 *         containers, in addition to application master and failed/killed
 *         containers.
 *     LimitSizeContainerLogAggregationPolicy: skip aggregation for killed
 *         containers whose log size exceeds the limit of container log size.
 *     If it isn't specified, it will use the cluster-wide default policy
 *     defined by configuration yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.policy.class.
 *     The default value of yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.policy.class is
 *     AllContainerLogAggregationPolicy.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     policyParameters. The parameters passed to the policy class via
 *     ContainerLogAggregationPolicy#parseParameters during the policy object
 *     initialization. This is optional. Some policy class might use parameters
 *     to adjust its settings. It is up to policy class to define the scheme of
 *     parameters.
 *     For example, SampleContainerLogAggregationPolicy supports the format of
 *     "SR:0.5,MIN:50", which means sample rate of 50% beyond the first 50
 *     successful worker containers.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
