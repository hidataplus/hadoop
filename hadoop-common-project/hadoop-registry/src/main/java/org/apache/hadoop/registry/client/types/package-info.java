/**
 * This package contains all the data types which can be saved to the registry
 * and/or marshalled to and from JSON.
 * <p>
 * The core datatypes, {@link org.apache.hadoop.registry.client.types.ServiceRecord},
 * and {@link org.apache.hadoop.registry.client.types.Endpoint} are
 * what is used to describe services and their protocol endpoints in the registry.
 * <p>
 * Some adjacent interfaces exist to list attributes of the fields:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.hadoop.registry.client.types.AddressTypes}</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.hadoop.registry.client.types.yarn.PersistencePolicies}</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.hadoop.registry.client.types.ProtocolTypes}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The {@link org.apache.hadoop.registry.client.types.RegistryPathStatus}
 * class is not saved to the registry â€”it is the status of a registry
 * entry that can be retrieved from the API call. It is still
 * designed to be marshalled to and from JSON, as it can be served up
 * from REST front ends to the registry.
